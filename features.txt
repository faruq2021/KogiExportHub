          
I need to analyze the feature list provided by the user and identify which features haven't been implemented yet in the KogiExportHub application. Based on the context, I can see we already have a basic marketplace with user profiles, products, transactions, and a seller dashboard. I'll need to check the existing codebase to determine which of the listed features are missing.
        
            
toolName: search_codebase
            
status: success
          
query: investor foreign investment funding proposal infrastructure
          
I need to check for existing controllers and models related to the features mentioned in the user's list, particularly focusing on the foreign investor engagement portal and infrastructure proposal modules which weren't found in the previous search.
        
            
toolName: search_codebase
            
status: success
          
query: controller model investor proposal infrastructure funding
          
I need to search for more specific features from the user's list that haven't been implemented yet. Let me search for models related to infrastructure funding, foreign investor engagement, and artisanal mining formalization.
        
            
toolName: search_codebase
            
status: success
          
query: model infrastructure funding investor proposal mining artisanal
          
Let me search for models related to the specific features mentioned in the user's list that we haven't found yet, particularly focusing on the infrastructure funding, artisanal mining, and foreign investor engagement features.
        
            
toolName: search_codebase
            
status: success
          
query: model infrastructure proposal funding investor mining artisanal notification
          
Let me check the Models directory to see what models are currently implemented in the application. This will help me identify which features from the user's list are missing.

status: success
          
c:\Users\USER\OneDrive\Desktop\kogi_app\KogiExportHub\Models
          
Let me examine the existing models to understand what features are already implemented and what's missing. I'll look at the key model files to get a better understanding of the current system architecture.

Let me check the remaining model files to get a complete picture of the current system.

Let me check the MarketplaceController and PaymentController to understand the current marketplace and payment functionality.

# KogiExportHub Feature Analysis

After examining your codebase, I've identified several key features from your list that haven't been implemented yet. Here's a breakdown of what's missing and what should be prioritized for your next development phase:

## Currently Implemented Features

Your application already has:

1. **Basic Buyer-Seller Marketplace**
   - User registration and profiles
   - Product listing and catalog
   - Basic search and filtering
   - Transaction processing
   - Payment integration with Flutterwave
   - Order management
   - Seller dashboard

2. **Basic Transaction System**
   - Payment processing
   - Receipt generation
   - Transaction history

## Missing Features (Prioritized)

### 1. Infrastructure Proposal & Funding Module
This entire module is missing and should be a top priority:
- No models for infrastructure proposals
- No funding request workflow
- No profit-sharing calculation system
- No project monitoring dashboard

### 2. Foreign Investor Engagement Portal
This feature set is completely absent:
- No investor-specific registration or verification
- No investment opportunity dashboard
- No ROI estimation tools
- No joint venture proposal submission system
- No direct messaging between investors and other stakeholders

### 3. Artisanal Mining Formalization
No implementation found for:
- Miner registration & licensing
- Mining activity logging
- Environmental compliance tracking

### 4. Automated Taxation and Revenue Tracking
While you have basic payment processing, you're missing:
- Dynamic tax rules engine
- Government revenue dashboard
- Tax receipt automation
- Leak detection alerts

### 5. Real-Time Notification System
Your application lacks:
- Comprehensive notification system for transactions, proposals, etc.
- SMS/Email notification integration (though you have basic email services)
- Push notification capabilities

### 6. Logistics and Supply Chain Management
Missing entirely:
- Transporter registration
- Delivery assignment and tracking
- Route optimization
- Proof of delivery system

### 7. Admin & Regulatory Dashboard
While you have a basic admin dashboard, you're missing:
- Trade monitoring tools
- Compliance enforcement panel
- Government & revenue analytics

### 8. Premium Features
No implementation for monetizable features:
- Product highlighting
- Trade analytics dashboard
- Investor Connect premium matchmaking

## Recommendation for Next Development Phase

I recommend prioritizing the **Infrastructure Proposal & Funding Module** for your next development phase because:

1. It's a unique differentiator for your platform
2. It enables critical economic development functionality
3. It creates a foundation for the investor engagement portal
4. It aligns with government partnership opportunities

This would require creating:
- New models for `InfrastructureProposal`, `FundingRequest`, and `ProjectMonitoring`
- Controllers for proposal submission, review, and approval
- Views for proposal creation, funding requests, and project tracking
- Services for profit-sharing calculations and Shari'a-compliant funding rules
